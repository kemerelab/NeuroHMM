# NeuroHMM—Analysis of neural data using hidden Markov models.
Example notebooks and discussions for the analysis of neural data using hidden Markov models on publically accessible data from crcns.org.

Of particular interest are the following:
 * **KLscore**.ipynb—preliminary results and proof-of-concept for a Kullback-Leibler based sequence score (almost complete)
 * ModelSelection.ipynb --- 
 * OnlineScoring --- to be completed
